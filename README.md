## The Problem

We have some basic source code. It has unit tests. None of them pass.

## Your Task

* Debug the tests
* Fix the source code so the tests pass
* Each function has a JSDoc above it explaining what it should do
* The mock service will always return positive numbers

## Rules

- You **may** use AI tools (Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
- You **should** be prepared to explain every line of code you write or generate
- You can ask us any question you would ask a coworker. I am here to help.
- Time limit: **60 minutes**

Good luck.
